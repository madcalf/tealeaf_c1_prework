# Final intro exercises
# 
# Exercise 1
# Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
# and print out each value.
puts "\n--- Exercise 1"
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
a.each { |elem| puts elem}

# Exercise 2
# Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.
puts "\n--- Exercise 2"
a.each do |elem|
  if elem > 5
    puts elem
  end
end

# Exercise 3
# Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract 
# all odd numbers into a new array.
puts "\n--- Exercise 3"
result = a.select { |elem| elem % 2 != 0}
puts result

# Exercise 4
# Append "11" to the end of the original array. Prepend "0" to the beginning.
puts "\n--- Exercise 4"
a.push(11)
a.unshift(0)
puts a

# Exercise 5
# Get rid of "11". And append a "3".
puts "\n--- Exercise 5"
a.pop
a.push(3)
puts a

# Exercise 6
# Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value.
puts "\n--- Exercise 6"
puts a.uniq!

# Exercise 7
# What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
# Array is an ordered list of items accessed by index that corresponds to it's 
#   position in the array (starting at 0)
# Hash is a list of key/value pairs. Each value is accessed by it's 
#  associated key. Keys can be of any type.

# Exercise 8
# Create a Hash using both Ruby syntax styles.

puts h
# 3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h.delete_if { |key, val| val < 3.5 }

# Exercise 10
# Can hash values be arrays? YES
# Can you have an array of hashes? YES
# (give examples)
puts "\n--- Exercise 10"

    nasty:["papaya", "spinach", "white chocolate"]}

# Exercise 12
# Write a program that moves the information from the array into the empty 
# hash that applies to the correct person.
